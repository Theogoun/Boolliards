# Boolliards

This is just to keep track of the code for the project

## Description of scripts
- Player1.gd is the movement for the first player and is modified, its not perfect though change it all you like
- Player2.gd is the movement for the second player and will always be the best version we have of the movement so dont change it much unless you are sure you have a better version
